        "- An **Embedding** layer (with a specified `padding_idx`)\n",
        "- An **LSTM** layer (with `batch_first=True`)\n",
        "- A **Fully Connected (fc)** layer to map the final hidden state to the output\n",

        "   Implement a class that builds and returns the RNN classifier model using the parameters provided.\n",

You can do so by clicking the \"Open in Collab\" badge below and opening this notebook from your repository there.\n",
